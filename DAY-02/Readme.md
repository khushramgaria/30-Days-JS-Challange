# Day 2: Operators

## Tasks/Activities:

### Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

1. Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
2. Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
3. Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
4. Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
5. Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

### Activity 2: Assignment Operators

6. Use the `+=` operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
7. Use the `-=` operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

### Activity 3: Comparison Operators

8. Write a program to compare two numbers using `>` and `<` and log the result to the console.
9. Write a program to compare two numbers using `>=` and `<=` and log the result to the console.
10. Write a program to compare two numbers using `==` and `===` and log the result to the console.

### Activity 4: Logical Operators

11. Write a program that uses the `&&` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
12. Write a program that uses the `||` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
13. Write a program that uses the `!` operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

### Activity 5: Ternary Operator

14. Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

## Feature Request:

1. **Arithmetic Operations Script**: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.
2. **Comparison and Logical Operators Script**: Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.
3. **Ternary Operator Script**: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.

## Achievement:

By the end of these activities, students will:
- Understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
- Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
- Use comparison operators to compare values.
- Use logical operators to combine conditions.
- Use the ternary operator to make concise conditional statements.
